/*while loop - used for looping until a condition is satisfied and when it is unsure how many times the code should be in loop

for loop - used for looping until a condition is satisfied but it is used when you know how many times the code needs to be in loop

do while loop - executes the content of the loop once before checking the condition of the while.*/
