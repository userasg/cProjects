 /*this conversion is different to the previous example there we are converting two seperate data types which is why when a float becomes an int it looses its decimal component.Due to this we have to explicitly convert an int to a float and vice versa eg i1=f1. Here we are not converting anything. All chars in c are ascii, and since all ascii characters have a int value assocaited with them we are simply telling program to treat them as an int when we specify the format %d. This also is why we can 'add' them together */
